# Research Projects and Publications

- Master's project published in [Optical response of hyperbolic metamaterials with adsorbed nanoparticle arrays](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/nh/d2nh00015f). The code for this project can be found in the repository [Msc-final-year-project](https://github.com/ferdiekrammer/Msc-final-year-project).

# Personal Projects

These are a range of different projects which I have undertaken/am undertaking and will make the code publicly available upon completion.
- currently constructing a generall CNN arcetecture structure for use in a VAE and GAN (not yet publicaly available)

# art-ai MRes

I have uploaded some of the work I produced during my MRes as part of the Acountable, Responsible, Transparent Center for Doctoral Training. This can be found in the [art-ai-MRes-year](https://github.com/ferdiekrammer/art-ai-MRes-year) repository
